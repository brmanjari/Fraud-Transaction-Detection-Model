# Fraud-Transaction-Detection-Model
🛡️ Fraud Detection Model

This project focuses on building a machine learning model to detect fraudulent financial transactions. It applies data preprocessing, feature scaling, model training, and evaluation techniques to identify patterns that distinguish fraudulent activity from legitimate transactions.

📌 Project Overview

Fraudulent transactions are rare but costly. This project leverages machine learning to:

Preprocess and scale raw financial transaction data

Train and validate a predictive model

Evaluate model performance on validation datasets

Save the trained model and scaler for reuse

⚙️ Tech Stack

Language: Python

Libraries:

pandas, numpy (data processing)

scikit-learn (modeling, preprocessing, evaluation)

matplotlib, seaborn (visualizations)

pickle (model serialization)

🚀 Features

Data cleaning and preprocessing

Feature scaling for numerical stability

Training with classification models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.)

Model evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC

Exporting trained model & scaler (fraud_detection_model.pkl) for production use

📂 Project Structure
Fraud Detection Model.ipynb   # Jupyter Notebook with full workflow
fraud_detection_model.pkl     # Saved trained model and scaler
README.md                     # Project documentation

📊 Workflow

Load and explore dataset

Preprocess and scale features

Train fraud detection model

Validate & evaluate results

Save trained model for deployment

🧪 Example Usage
import pickle

# Load model & scaler
with open("fraud_detection_model.pkl", "rb") as f:
    saved = pickle.load(f)

model = saved["model"]
scaler = saved["scaler"]
features = saved["features"]

# Scale input and predict fraud probability
scaled_input = scaler.transform(new_data[features])
fraud_prob = model.predict_proba(scaled_input)[:, 1]

📈 Results

The model achieves strong performance on detecting fraudulent transactions while minimizing false positives.

ROC-AUC and precision-recall metrics indicate its effectiveness in highly imbalanced datasets.

🔮 Future Improvements

Experiment with deep learning approaches (e.g., LSTMs for sequential transaction patterns)

Deploy as an API for real-time fraud detection

Apply advanced techniques like SMOTE/ensemble learning to handle class imbalance
